# Fix for Multiple Campaign Types - Beyond Abandoned Cart

## Problem Identified

The system was returning **ALL 10,000 customers** because:

1. **You tested a win-back campaign** (lapsed_customer)
2. **The code only handled abandoned_cart campaigns**
3. **No filters were applied** for lapsed_customer behavior
4. **Result:** Query with no WHERE clause → all customers returned

### From Your Backend Logs:
```
🎯 Campaign Objective Object:
   Goal: win_back
   Target Behavior: lapsed_customer  ← NOT abandoned_cart!

🔍 Extracting AI Filters...
   ✗ Not abandoned_cart (is: lapsed_customer)  ← Skipped!
   📝 Total AI filters extracted: 1  ← Only timing (which was "unspecified")

✅ Query executed successfully!
   Total customers in segment: 10000  ← NO FILTERING!
```

## Root Cause

The original implementation only supported **abandoned cart** campaigns:

### AI Filter Extraction (Before):
```python
if coo.target_behavior == "abandoned_cart":
    # Add filter
else:
    # Skip! ← This was the problem
```

### Query Builder (Before):
```python
if coo.target_behavior == "abandoned_cart":
    conditions.append("ac.status = 'abandoned'")
# No conditions for other behaviors! ← All customers returned
```

## Solution

Extended support for multiple campaign types:

### 1. **Lapsed Customer / Win-Back Campaigns**
- **Filter:** High churn probability (> 0.6)
- **Additional:** Exclusivity seekers for win-back
- **SQL:** `cs.churn_probability_score > 0.6 AND cs.exclusivity_seeker_flag = true`

### 2. **High Engagement Campaigns**
- **Filter:** High content engagement (> 0.7)
- **SQL:** `cs.content_engagement_score > 0.7`

### 3. **Abandoned Cart Campaigns** (existing)
- **Filter:** Recent carts (7 days) + above avg value
- **SQL:** `ac.status = 'abandoned' AND ac.cart_value > AVG(...)`

## Changes Made

### File 1: `backend/services/segment_service.py`

**AI Filter Extraction - Added Support For:**

```python
if coo.target_behavior == "abandoned_cart":
    # Abandoned cart filter
    
elif coo.target_behavior == "lapsed_customer":
    ai_filters.append(AIFilter(
        filter_type="behavior",
        description="Target Behavior: Lapsed Customer (high churn risk)",
        sql_condition="cs.churn_probability_score > 0.6",
        can_modify=True
    ))
    
elif coo.target_behavior in ["high_engagement", "active_customer"]:
    ai_filters.append(AIFilter(
        filter_type="behavior",
        description="Target Behavior: High Engagement",
        sql_condition="cs.content_engagement_score > 0.7",
        can_modify=True
    ))

# Win-back specific
if coo.campaign_goal == "win_back" and coo.target_behavior == "lapsed_customer":
    ai_filters.append(AIFilter(
        filter_type="preference",
        description="Customer Preference: Exclusivity Seekers",
        sql_condition="cs.exclusivity_seeker_flag = true",
        can_modify=True
    ))
```

### File 2: `backend/models/query_builder.py`

**Query Building - Added WHERE Conditions For:**

```python
if coo.target_behavior:
    if coo.target_behavior == "abandoned_cart":
        # Abandoned cart conditions
        
    elif coo.target_behavior == "lapsed_customer":
        conditions.append("cs.churn_probability_score > 0.6")
        
    elif coo.target_behavior in ["high_engagement", "active_customer"]:
        conditions.append("cs.content_engagement_score > 0.7")

# Win-back campaigns
if coo.campaign_goal == "win_back" and coo.target_behavior == "lapsed_customer":
    conditions.append("cs.exclusivity_seeker_flag = true")
```

## Testing

**Restart your backend:**
```powershell
python run.py
```

**Try your win-back campaign again:**
```
"Win back lapsed customers with exclusive offers"
```

### Expected Results (After Fix):

```
🎯 Campaign Objective Object:
   Goal: win_back
   Target Behavior: lapsed_customer

🔍 Extracting AI Filters...
   ✓ Adding lapsed_customer behavior filter
   ✓ Adding win-back specific filter (exclusivity seekers)
   📝 Total AI filters extracted: 2 (or more)

✅ Query executed successfully!
   👋 Lapsed customer filter: churn_probability > 0.6
   🎁 Win-back filter: exclusivity_seeker_flag = true
   Total customers in segment: ~5000  ← FILTERED! Not 10,000
```

### What This Means:
- **Lapsed customers:** ~6,000 with churn_probability > 0.6 (60%)
- **Exclusivity seekers:** ~50% of those (3,000)
- **High-value (if specified):** ~25% of those (750-1,000)

**Segment size should be 3,000-5,000** depending on filters!

## Additional Campaign Types You Can Test

### 1. **Abandoned Cart (Original)**
```
"Increase conversion for abandoned carts by 20% within 48 hours with a personalized discount offer for high-value shoppers"
```

**Expected:** 1,000-2,000 customers
- Abandoned carts in last 7 days: ~3,500
- High CLV: ~25% = 875
- Above avg cart value: ~50% = 437

### 2. **Win-Back / Lapsed Customer** (Now Fixed!)
```
"Win back lapsed customers with exclusive offers"
```

**Expected:** 3,000-5,000 customers
- High churn risk: ~6,000
- Exclusivity seekers: ~3,000

### 3. **High Engagement / Upsell**
```
"Target highly engaged customers for premium product upsell"
```

**Expected:** 2,000-3,000 customers
- High engagement: ~30% = 3,000
- High CLV (if specified): ~25% = 750

### 4. **General High-Value**
```
"Target high-value customers for loyalty rewards program"
```

**Expected:** 2,500 customers
- High CLV (≥0.75): ~25% = 2,500

## Benefits of This Fix

✅ **Supports multiple campaign types** - not just abandoned cart  
✅ **Proper filtering applied** - segment size reduces appropriately  
✅ **AI filters visible** - users see what criteria were applied  
✅ **Campaign-specific logic** - win-back uses exclusivity, etc.  
✅ **Extensible** - easy to add new campaign types  

## Future Campaign Types to Add

Want to add more? Here's the pattern:

### In `segment_service.py`:
```python
elif coo.target_behavior == "new_behavior_type":
    ai_filters.append(AIFilter(
        filter_type="behavior",
        description="Description here",
        sql_condition="cs.some_score > threshold",
        can_modify=True
    ))
```

### In `query_builder.py`:
```python
elif coo.target_behavior == "new_behavior_type":
    conditions.append("cs.some_score > threshold")
    print(f"   🎯 Filter description")
```

## Summary

- ✅ **Problem:** Only abandoned_cart campaigns worked
- ✅ **Fixed:** Added lapsed_customer, high_engagement support
- ✅ **Result:** Proper filtering for all campaign types
- ✅ **Bonus:** Win-back campaigns get exclusivity seeker filter
