- **Backend**: Python (Flask), Pandas, NumPy
- **AI/LLM**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash via Vertex AI
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Deployment**: Local development server

### Key Components

1. **Campaign Intent Interpreter** - Gemini-powered natural language processor
2. **Causal Segmentation Engine** - Uplift score simulation for trigger optimization
3. **BigQuery Data Layer** - Synthetic customer dataset with rich behavioral attributes
4. **REST API** - Segment activation and analysis endpoints
5. **Interactive UI** - Three-stage refinement workflow

## 📊 Data Model

### BigQuery Tables

#### `customers` (10,000 records)
- Customer identity and demographics
- Location data (city, country)
- CLV scores
- Acquisition source and creation date

#### `transactions` (50,000+ records)
- Purchase history with realistic furniture pricing
- Product categories and names
- Order values ($10-$2,500 depending on category)

#### `behavioral_events` (100,000+ records)
- Website/app interactions
- Product views, cart actions, wishlist additions
- Session duration and engagement metrics
- **New**: Room planner usage, AR views, stock checks

#### `abandoned_carts` (2,000+ records)
- Cart abandonment data (70% within last 7 days)
- Multi-item carts with furniture products
- Cart values and item details

#### `campaign_history` (20+ campaigns)
- Historical campaign performance
- Control/treatment groups for uplift modeling
- Conversion tracking

#### `customer_scores`
- ML-derived propensity scores
- Discount sensitivity, free shipping sensitivity
- Churn probability, content engagement
- Exclusivity seeker flags

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Google Cloud Project with BigQuery enabled
- Service account with BigQuery permissions

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate (Mac/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Google Cloud Configuration
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION=us-central1
BIGQUERY_DATASET=aethersegment_cdp
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/service-account-key.json

# Flask Configuration
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_DEBUG=True
FLASK_PORT=5000

# CORS Configuration
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*
```

### 3. Generate Initial Data

```bash
# Generate all synthetic data (10,000 customers, 50K+ transactions, etc.)
python scripts/generate_data.py
```

This will:
- Create all BigQuery tables
- Generate 10,000 customer profiles across 4 countries
- Create 50,000+ furniture purchase transactions
- Generate 100,000+ behavioral events
- Create 2,000+ abandoned carts
- Populate customer propensity scores

### 4. Start the Backend

```bash
# Run the Flask application
python run.py
```

Backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### 5. Open the Frontend

Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser, or use a local server:

```bash
# Using Python's built-in server
cd frontend
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`

## 🔄 Near Real-Time Event Generation

To simulate ongoing customer activity and demonstrate near real-time capabilities:

```bash
# Add 500 new events (default)
python scripts/add_realtime_events.py

# Add custom number of events
python scripts/add_realtime_events.py 1000
```

This incremental script:
- ✅ Fetches the last event timestamp from BigQuery
- ✅ Generates new events distributed between then and now
- ✅ Uses realistic furniture browsing behavior patterns
- ✅ Appends events without regenerating existing data
- ✅ Perfect for demonstrating live CDP capabilities

**Tip**: Run this script periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes with a cron job or Task Scheduler) to continuously populate your CDP with fresh activity.

## 🎯 Example Campaign Objectives

Try these natural language campaign objectives:

### Abandoned Cart Recovery
```
"Recover abandoned furniture carts from high-value customers in the last 48 hours 
with a personalized 15% discount to increase conversion by 25%"
```

### Cross-Sell to Recent Buyers
```
"Recommend complementary furniture items to customers who purchased sofas 
in the last 30 days to drive cross-sell revenue by 20%"
```

### Win-Back Lapsed Customers
```
"Re-engage customers with high churn risk who haven't purchased in 90 days 
using exclusive offers to bring back 15%"
```

### New Customer Onboarding
```
"Welcome new customers acquired in the last 7 days with free shipping 
to encourage first purchase and boost repeat rate by 30%"
```

### Geographic Expansion
```
"Target high CLV customers in London and Manchester with exclusive 
new product launches to drive regional sales growth"
```

## 🎨 UI Workflow

### Step 1: Campaign Input
- Enter natural language campaign objective
- AI interprets intent and extracts structured data

### Step 2: Campaign Analysis
- View AI interpretation (Campaign Objective Object)
- See full eligible segment with AI-applied filters
- Review segment size, avg CLV, predicted uplift

### Step 3: Refine Segment (Optional)
- Review AI-applied filters
- Add custom filters:
  - Location (country, city)
  - Customer value (CLV threshold)
  - Cart value (for abandoned cart campaigns)
- Preview filter impact before applying

### Step 4: Select Trigger & Activate
- Review final segment metrics
- Choose from AI-ranked trigger recommendations
- View explainability (why this segment?)
- Create segment and export customer list
