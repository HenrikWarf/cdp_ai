## 📊 Data Sources

### Real Data from BigQuery (100% Actual)

The system pulls these **real customer attributes** from your BigQuery database:

| Column | Source Table | What It Represents | Example Values |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| `discount_sensitivity_score` | `customer_scores` | How responsive this customer is to discounts | 0.002 to 0.999 |
| `free_shipping_sensitivity_score` | `customer_scores` | How much free shipping influences their purchase | 0.002 to 0.981 |
| `exclusivity_seeker_flag` | `customer_scores` | Whether they prefer exclusive/VIP offers | True/False (0 or 1) |
| `social_proof_affinity` | `customer_scores` | How influenced they are by reviews/popularity | 0.001 to 0.998 |
| `content_engagement_score` | `customer_scores` | How much they engage with content/education | 0 to 1 |
| `clv_score` | `customers` | Customer Lifetime Value score | 0 to 1 |
| `churn_probability_score` | `customer_scores` | Risk of customer churning | 0 to 1 |

**Each of the 10,000 customers in your database has unique values for these scores.**

### Research-Based Trigger Effectiveness (Marketing Science)

Based on industry research and A/B testing benchmarks, different trigger types have different base effectiveness rates:

| Trigger Type | Base Effectiveness | Why |
|--------------|-------------------|-----|
| Personalized Discount | 75% | Highly targeted offers work very well |
| Generic Discount | 72% | Discounts are universally effective |
| Free Shipping | 68% | Major barrier removal |
| Bundling | 63% | Creates perceived value |
| Scarcity | 60% | FOMO effect (moderate) |
| Exclusivity | 58% | Works for status-seekers |
| Social Proof | 55% | Influence varies by product |

## 🧮 The Calculation Formula

For each customer and each trigger, the system calculates a **personalized uplift score** using this formula:

```
Final Uplift Score = 
  (Customer Sensitivity Score × 70%) +           ← Real data from BigQuery
  (Trigger Base Effectiveness × 30%) +           ← Research-based constant
  (CLV Adjustment) +                             ← Real data from BigQuery
  (Campaign Alignment Bonus) +                   ← AI-driven matching
  (Realistic Noise)                              ← Natural variation
```

### Detailed Breakdown

#### 1. Customer Sensitivity Score (70% Weight)
**Source:** Real BigQuery data

The system maps each trigger to the relevant sensitivity score:
- **Discount triggers** → `discount_sensitivity_score`
- **Free shipping triggers** → `free_shipping_sensitivity_score`
- **Exclusivity triggers** → `exclusivity_seeker_flag`
- **Social proof triggers** → `social_proof_affinity`

**Example:** Customer A has `discount_sensitivity_score = 0.85`
- Weighted contribution: `0.85 × 0.7 = 0.595`

#### 2. Trigger Base Effectiveness (30% Weight)
**Source:** Marketing research benchmarks

Different triggers have different baseline effectiveness:
- **Personalized Discount:** 75% base
- **Free Shipping:** 68% base
- **Exclusivity:** 58% base

**Example:** For "discount" trigger with 72% base effectiveness:
- Weighted contribution: `0.72 × 0.3 = 0.216`

#### 3. CLV Adjustment (Up to ±7.5%)
**Source:** Real BigQuery data from `customers.clv_score`

High-value customers respond better to most marketing triggers:
```
CLV Boost = (CLV Score - 0.5) × 0.15
```

**Example:** Customer with `clv_score = 0.85`:
- CLV Boost: `(0.85 - 0.5) × 0.15 = +0.0525 (+5.25%)`

**Example:** Customer with `clv_score = 0.25`:
- CLV Boost: `(0.25 - 0.5) × 0.15 = -0.0375 (-3.75%)`

#### 4. Campaign Alignment Bonus (+8%)
**Source:** AI-driven matching (Gemini interpretation)

If the trigger matches what the campaign objective mentions, add 8%.

**Example:** Campaign says "exclusive early access" and trigger is "exclusivity":
- Alignment Bonus: `+0.08 (+8%)`

#### 5. Realistic Noise
**Source:** Statistical modeling

Adds natural variation to simulate real-world unpredictability:
```
Noise = Normal Distribution(mean=0, std_dev=variance/3)
```
- Discount triggers: Lower variance (±5%)
- Social proof triggers: Higher variance (±6%)

## 🔍 Real Example from Your System

### Campaign: "Win-back lapsed customers with exclusive early access"

**Gemini Interpretation:**
- `proposed_intervention`: "exclusivity"
- `target_behavior`: "lapsed_customer"
- `campaign_goal`: "win_back"

**BigQuery Query Results:** 1,000 customers analyzed

### Trigger Comparison Results

| Trigger | Customer Data Used | Mean Customer Score | Final Avg Uplift | High Performers |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Exclusivity** | `exclusivity_seeker_flag` | 0.554 (55.4% are seekers) | **64.9%** | **554 (55.4%)** |
| Personalized Discount | `discount_sensitivity_score` | 0.486 | 59.8% | 444 (44.4%) |
| Free Shipping | `free_shipping_sensitivity_score` | 0.512 | 59.2% | 421 (42.1%) |
| Scarcity | `discount_sensitivity_score` | 0.486 | 55.1% | 362 (36.2%) |
| Social Proof | `social_proof_affinity` | 0.505 | 55.1% | 375 (37.5%) |

### Why Exclusivity Won

**For a typical high-value customer in this segment:**

```
Customer Profile (Real BigQuery Data):
- exclusivity_seeker_flag: 1.0 (True - they love exclusive offers)
- clv_score: 0.85 (high value customer)
- Customer ID: cust_004567

Calculation for "Exclusivity" Trigger:
1. Base sensitivity: 1.0 × 0.7 = 0.700
2. Trigger effectiveness: 0.58 × 0.3 = 0.174
3. CLV boost: (0.85 - 0.5) × 0.15 = +0.053
4. Campaign alignment: +0.08 (matches objective)
5. Noise: +0.012
───────────────────────────────────────
Final Uplift Score: 1.0 (capped at 95%) = 0.95

Result: 95% predicted uplift for this customer!
```

**For the same customer with "Discount" trigger:**
```
1. Base sensitivity: 0.42 × 0.7 = 0.294  (lower discount sensitivity)
2. Trigger effectiveness: 0.72 × 0.3 = 0.216
3. CLV boost: +0.053 (same)
4. Campaign alignment: 0 (doesn't match objective)
5. Noise: -0.008
───────────────────────────────────────
Final Uplift Score: 0.555

Result: 55.5% predicted uplift
```

**Difference:** Exclusivity is 39.5% more effective for this customer!

## ✅ What's Real vs. What's Simulated

### REAL (From Your BigQuery Database)

✅ **Customer sensitivity scores** - Every customer has unique scores
✅ **CLV scores** - Actual customer lifetime value calculations  
✅ **Exclusivity seeker flags** - Real behavioral segmentation
✅ **Social proof affinity** - Real engagement patterns
✅ **Number of customers** - Actual database count (10,000)
✅ **Segment composition** - Real distribution of characteristics

### SIMULATED (Not from Real A/B Tests)

⚠️ **Trigger base effectiveness percentages** - Based on industry research, not your specific A/B tests
⚠️ **Campaign history outcomes** - Generated synthetic data with realistic patterns
⚠️ **Actual conversion rates** - Would need real campaign results to validate

**Important:** The customer characteristics are 100% real. The trigger effectiveness multipliers are research-based estimates. Once you run real campaigns, you can train the uplift models on actual results to replace the simulated values.

---

## 🎯 Why This Approach Works

### 1. Personalization
Every customer gets a unique score based on their actual characteristics, not a one-size-fits-all estimate.

### 2. Differentiation
Different triggers score differently for the same customer based on their real preferences:
- Price-sensitive customers → High discount scores
- Status-seekers → High exclusivity scores
- Social validators → High social proof scores

### 3. Business Alignment
Triggers that match your campaign objective get bonus points, ensuring AI recommendations align with your marketing strategy.

### 4. Scalability
As you collect real A/B test data, the system can replace the research-based multipliers with your actual performance data, making it even more accurate.

## 📈 How to Interpret the Results

### Uplift Score Ranges

| Score Range | Interpretation | Action |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| **65-95%** | High predicted uplift | ✅ Prioritize this trigger |
| **50-65%** | Moderate uplift | ⚠️ Test and measure |
| **15-50%** | Lower effectiveness | ❌ Consider alternatives |

### Confidence Metrics

**High Performers (>65%)** shows what percentage of the segment will likely respond well:
- **>50%** = Strong segment, high conversion potential
- **30-50%** = Moderate segment, good for testing
- **<30%** = Weaker segment, may need refinement

---
